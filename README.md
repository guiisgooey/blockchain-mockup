# BlockChain Mockup Program

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following software is required to run this program:

```
Python Version 2.7 or later
```

```
Pysha3 Version 1.0.2
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Create a Python Virtual Environment: 

    On Windows:

    Open the desired location of your virtual environment in the command prompt and run the following line, where 'environment_name' is the desired named of your virtual environment:

    ```
    python -m venv environment_name
    ```

    On Mac/Linux:

    Open the desired location of your virtual environment in the terminal and run the following line, where 'environment_name' is the desired named of your virtual environment:

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv environment_name
    ```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    On Windows:

    Run the following command in the directory of the repository in the command prompt:

    ```
    environment_name\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    On Mac/Linux:

    Run the following command in the directory of your virtual environment in the terminal:

    ```
    $ source environment_name/bin/activate
    ```

4. Download the prerequisites listed in requirements.txt using the following line of code:

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    To verify that the requirements are installed you may run:

    ```
    $ pip list
    ```

5. Run main.py

    Windows:

    Run the following code in the repository's directory in the terminal:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

    Mac/Linux:

    Run the following code in the repository's directory in the terminal:

    ```
    $python3 main.py
    ```

    You may also run the code in any IDE that supports Python aslong as scripts are enabled on your system.
